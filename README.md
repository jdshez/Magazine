##Recreating a nicely designed webpage for Backstage magazine.
#Brief
#I chose to recreate this page as I really liked the design with it's minimal layout, attractive color scheme and the full page scroll with background colour transition caught my eye and was something that I was intruiged by.
#Learning experience 
#As I mentioned the layout is very simple for this page, however I did come across one issue with it! I combined the element (mini-menu) on the bottom-right of the page with the element on bottom-left in a flex row. Essentially this 'footer' looked fine, however it rendered the links in the main body of the page inaccessible, oops! So I removed the flex container, treated them as individual elements and positioned them accordingly - problem solved.  
#Now the main challenge here
